- **GAN**: Simple implementation a GAN whose Generator and Discriminator are simple feed-forward neural networks with different hidden layer.

- **DCGAN 64x64** :Simple implementation a GAN whose Generator and Discriminator are convolutional neural networks

- **WGAN 64x64** :  Wasserstein GAN, an alternative to traditional GAN training. Use Wasserstein loss to train the discriminator and generator models that promote larger difference between scores for real and generated images.






## Requirements
